# Timesheet Formatter

Timesheet Formatter is a program to make the hours section of the required timesheet a little quicker.  It is written in C but doesn't use anything more complicated than a pointer. 

## Getting Started

After you clone the repository you will need to compile the timesheet.c file.  
I compile using gcc and standard C11.

```
gcc -std=c11 timesheet.c
```

If you want to name the outputed file use the -o flag, and put the desired name after the file to compile. The default output name is a.out.

***

Type the path to the output to run the program.

```
./a.out
```

After running the program generates a file name TimeSheet.txt, this is where you copy the inputed hours from.
